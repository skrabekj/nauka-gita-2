      <h1>Diluted</h1>
      <h3>by SlipKnot</h3>
      <p>I'm cold, I'm ugly<br>
      I'm always confused by everything<br>
      I can stare into a thousand eyes<br>
      But every smile hides a bold-faced lie</p>

      <p>It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes<br>
      My heros are dead, they died in my head<br>
      Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain<br>
      Something inside me has opened up again</p>

      <p>Thoughts of me exemplified<br>
      All the little flaws I have denied<br>
      Forget today, forget whatever happened<br>
      Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies<br>
      I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe</p>

      <p>What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this?</p>

      <p>I save all the bullets from ignorant minds<br>
      Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind<br>
      Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens<br>
      I decrease, while my symptoms increase</p>

      <p>God what the fuck is wrong<br>
      You act like you knew it all along<br>
      Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing</p>

      <p>All I ever wanted out of you was<br>
      something you could never be <br>
      Now take a real good look at <br>
      What you've fucking done to me<p>

      <p>Gimme any reason why I'd need you, boy <br>
      Gimme any reason not to fuck you up <br>
      Gimme any reason why I'd need you, bitch <br>
      Gimme any reason not to fuck you up</p>

      <p>I see you in me</p>

      <p>I keep my scars from prying eyes <br>
      Incapable of ever knowing why <br>
      Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer<br>
      Why am I so fascinated by <br>
      bigger pictures, better things <br>
      But I don't care what you think <br>
      You'll never understand me</p>
